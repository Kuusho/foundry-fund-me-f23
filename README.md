## FUND ME 

### WHAT SHOULD THIS CODE DO?

This is a simple Fundraiser Contract.

The fact that this Aboutme is changed from the default means it is now a playground for learning and playing with this code.

Here's what it SHOULD do:

1. Allow anyone fund it with a minimum of $5.
2. Allow funds be withdrawn only by the contract owner.

That's all.


## WHAT CAN CHANGE?

This is a rather simple contract that can be played with in a variety of ways:

1. let only certain people fund it.
2. randomly change the owner to one of the funders address.
3. stop receiving funds after reaching a certain limit.
